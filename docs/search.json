    "section": "",
    "text": "West Nile Virus (WNV) is the most common mosquito-transmitted virus in the United States. It is primarily spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Although most people who get infected with the virus experience mild symptoms, approximately 1 in 5 individuals will develop symptoms such as fever, headache, vomiting, or a rash (CDC, 2024). In rare cases, about 1 in 150 infected individuals will develop more serious conditions, such as encephalitis or meningitis, which can be life-threatening (CDC, 2024).\n\n\n\nPast studies suggest that weather patterns, specifically rainfall and temperature, can influence the incidence of WNV cases. Heavy rainfall, in particular, has been linked to an increase in the number of reported cases. For example, past research (Soverow et al., 2009) has shown that rainfall within a week can be associated with a 29–66% increase in the incidence of WNV in the following weeks. However, other studies indicate that temperature may be a stronger predictor than rainfall in determining the risk of infection (Shand et al., 2016).\nSomething of note in the Shand et al. paper is that they were looking at infection rates of mosquitoes, as opposed to human infections. With this, there may be different results because WNV so often does not have noticeable symptoms in people, there probably are more people infected than can be accounted for. Shand et. al. used a statistical linear regression with information about past weather events. In some models, they also used lagged previous infection cases as an independent variable to help predict future infections. Soverow, et al. used a conditional logistic regression in their analysis and also found results that even heavy rainfall within the past week can lead to higher WNV cases.\nFor this analysis, I decided to focus on Los Angeles County and analyze whether recent rainfall patterns correlate with WNV cases over 10 years from 2013 to 2023.\nNull Hypothesis (H₀): There is no relationship between precipitation and reported WNV cases.\nAlternative Hypothesis (H₁): Higher levels of rainfall will be associated with more reported WNV cases.\n\n\n\nThe data for this analysis comes from two sources:\nWest Nile Virus Cases: Reported by the California Department of Public Health, covering 2006 to 2024. https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/west-nile-virus-cases-2006-present\nRainfall Data: Rainfall data for Arcadia, a city in LA County. This data was requested from NOAAs Climate Data Online: Dataset Discovery portal. https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load in libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Read in data\nwnv_cases &lt;- read_csv(here('blog_posts', '2024-13-2024-WNV_cases_in_LA', 'data', 'vendor.csv'))\narcadia &lt;- read_csv(here('blog_posts', '2024-13-2024-WNV_cases_in_LA', 'data', '3862608.csv'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenaming Columns: Standardized column names for easier manipulation.\n\n\nCode\nwnv_cases &lt;- wnv_cases %&gt;% \n  rename(\n    year = 'Year', \n    week = 'Week', \n    county = 'County', \n    reported_positive_cases = 'Reported Positive Cases'\n  )\n\n\nFiltering Data: Focused analysis on Los Angeles County (2013–2023).\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for years and county\nwnv_cases_la &lt;- wnv_cases %&gt;% \n  filter(county == \"Los Angeles\", year &gt;= 2013, year &lt;= 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nDate Processing: Extracted year and week number from daily rainfall data.\n\n\nCode\n# Extract week number \narcadia &lt;- arcadia %&gt;%\n  mutate(week = isoweek(DATE), year = year(DATE))\n\n\nWeekly Averages: Calculated average rainfall for each week.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate average rainfall for week\narcadia_avg &lt;- arcadia %&gt;% \n  group_by(year, week) %&gt;% \n  summarize(avg_weekly_prcp = mean(PRCP, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerged rainfall and WNV cases data by year and week.\nMissing weeks in the WNV dataset were filled with 0 cases, assuming no cases were reported in those weeks.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Merge rainfall and WNV cases by year and week and make missing weeks 0\nwnv_precip &lt;- full_join(wnv_cases_la, arcadia_avg, by = c(\"year\", \"week\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    reported_positive_cases = replace_na(reported_positive_cases, 0),\n    county = replace_na(county, \"Los Angeles\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(wnv_cases_la, aes(x = week, y = reported_positive_cases)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"navy\", se = FALSE) + \n  geom_point(color = \"firebrick\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Reported West Nile Virus Cases by Week in Los Angeles County\",\n    x = \"Week of the Year\",\n    y = \"Number of Reported Cases\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation Of Graph\nThis graph shows the number of reported cases of WNV throughout the ten year period. There was a spike in WNV cases in 2017 in LA County with 268 infections (up from 153 in 2016) and 27 deaths (up from 6 in 2016)(LACDPH, 2018). Before 2017, 2015 had been the most fatal year for WNV with 24 deaths (). The spike in cases happened in October, 2017 and with the most cases being reported week 41 (7. Oct - 13. Oct).\n1.

These graphs also show the spike in cases in 2017. Some experts attributed this spike in cases to an unusually wet winter (CDPH, 2017).\n\n\nCode\n# Filter the data for 2017\nwnv_precip_2017 &lt;- wnv_precip %&gt;% \n  filter(year == 2017)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Plot the graph for 2017\nggplot(wnv_precip_2017, aes(x = week, group = year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = avg_weekly_prcp, color = \"Rainfall\"), size = 1) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = reported_positive_cases, color = \"WNV Cases\"), size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Week\",\n    y = \"Values\",\n    title = \"Weekly Rainfall and West Nile Virus Cases in 2017\",\n    color = \"Legend\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Rainfall\" = \"navy\", \"WNV Cases\" = \"firebrick\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis zoomed in graph of 2017 shows the slight spike in precipitation at the beginning of the year.\n2. Autocorrelation of WNV Cases\nComputed the autocorrelation function (ACF) to determine if WNV cases exhibit temporal dependencies.\n\n\nCode\nacf(wnv_precip$reported_positive_cases, na.action = na.pass, main = \"ACF of WNV Cases\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of Graph\nI wanted to include an autocorrelation graph in this analysis because WNV is spread by vectors, and because WNV cases tend to spite in the summer and fall months. The spikes on the far left of this graph are consistent with what would be expected of a virus with seasonal spikes. This graph shows that WNV cases are often reported within a few weeks of each other, particularly within 5 weeks. These results are as-expected.\n\n\nCode\n# Fit a linear model between rainfall and WNV cases\nrain_case_model &lt;- lm(reported_positive_cases ~ avg_weekly_prcp, data = wnv_precip)\n\n# Summary of the model to check coefficients and significance\nsummary(rain_case_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = reported_positive_cases ~ avg_weekly_prcp, data = wnv_precip)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-2.411 -2.411 -2.395 -1.383 37.589 \n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)       2.4113     0.2507   9.618   &lt;2e-16 ***\navg_weekly_prcp  -1.3915     1.2687  -1.097    0.273    \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 5.633 on 547 degrees of freedom\n  (35 observations deleted due to missingness)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.002194,  Adjusted R-squared:  0.0003703 \nF-statistic: 1.203 on 1 and 547 DF,  p-value: 0.2732\n\n\nSummary Analysis\nWe can see that according to our p-value (p = 0.2732), these results are not significant and that, in this case, precipitation is not a significant predictor of WNV cases. Our intercept is 2.4113 which means that when there is no rainfall, the model predicts about 2.41 reported WNV cases. Unexpectedly, with our avg_weekly_prcp coefficient being -1.3915, this model would predict that for each inch of rainfall there would be -1.3915 cases of WNV. The Multiple R-squared (0.002194) also supports these results being insignificant, as it describes only 0.22% of WNV case variation could be explained by precipitation.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate the correlation between rainfall and WNV cases\ncorrelation &lt;- cor(wnv_precip$avg_weekly_prcp, wnv_precip$reported_positive_cases, use = \"complete.obs\")\nprint(paste(\"Correlation between rainfall and WNV cases:\", correlation))\n\n\n[1] \"Correlation between rainfall and WNV cases: -0.0468444447379296\"\n\n\nThis correlation (-0.0468) is consistent with our previous findings that rainfall would have a negative correlation with WNV cases.\n\n\nCode\n# Visualize the relationship with the regression line\nggplot(wnv_precip, aes(x = avg_weekly_prcp, y = reported_positive_cases)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"firebrick\") + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"glm\", color = \"navy\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Rainfall and West Nile Virus Cases\",\n    x = \"Average Weekly Rainfall (inches)\",\n    y = \"Reported Positive WNV Cases\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, the analysis has shown unexpected results that are inconsistent with the results from prior research, except for the autocorrelation function. I thought lagging the rainfall variable may show results more consistent with the papers.\n1. Lagged Variables\nCreated a lagged rainfall variable to explore delayed effects of precipitation on WNV cases.\n\n\nCode\nwnv_precip &lt;- wnv_precip %&gt;% \n  mutate(lag_prcp_4weeks = lag(avg_weekly_prcp, 4))\n\n\n2. Correlation Analysis\nExamined the correlation between rainfall 4 weeks prior and WNV cases.\n\n\nCode\ncorrelation &lt;- cor(wnv_precip$lag_prcp_4weeks, wnv_precip$reported_positive_cases, use = \"complete.obs\")\nprint(paste(\"Correlation between rainfall 4 weeks ago and WNV cases:\", correlation))\n\n\n[1] \"Correlation between rainfall 4 weeks ago and WNV cases: -0.0669666699724962\"\n\n\n3. Regression Analysis\nFitted a linear model to quantify the relationship between lagged rainfall and WNV cases.\n\n\nCode\nmodel &lt;- lm(reported_positive_cases ~ lag_prcp_4weeks, data = wnv_precip)\nsummary(model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = reported_positive_cases ~ lag_prcp_4weeks, data = wnv_precip)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-2.460 -2.460 -2.436 -1.199 37.540 \n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)       2.4597     0.2579   9.536   &lt;2e-16 ***\nlag_prcp_4weeks  -2.0339     1.3005  -1.564    0.118    \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 5.773 on 543 degrees of freedom\n  (39 observations deleted due to missingness)\nMultiple R-squared:  0.004485,  Adjusted R-squared:  0.002651 \nF-statistic: 2.446 on 1 and 543 DF,  p-value: 0.1184\n\n\nIn a very generous sense, using the lagged variable did show results that were slightly more like those in the research paper. However, the results are still completely different. With the lagged variable, the p-value is still not significant (p = 0.1184). The coefficient for the intercept did go up slightly, with the difference being 0.0484. Our lag_prcp_4weeks coefficient being -2.0339 means that for every inch of rain in the past 4 weeks, there would be -2.03 WNV cases. Lastly, we can see only about 0.45% of the variability in reported WNV cases can be explained by lagged precipitation.\n4. Visualization of Regression\nVisualized the relationship between lagged rainfall and WNV cases.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(wnv_precip, aes(x = lag_prcp_4weeks, y = reported_positive_cases)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"glm\", color = \"navy\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Rainfall (4 Weeks Ago) and WNV Cases\",\n    x = \"Average Weekly Rainfall (4 Weeks Ago)\",\n    y = \"Reported Positive WNV Cases\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContrary to initial expectations, the data failed to demonstrate a statistically significant relationship between rainfall and West Nile Virus cases. The negative correlation and elevated p-values suggest that precipitation alone may not be a reliable predictor of virus transmission in Los Angeles County. In this analysis, I have failed to reject the null hypothesis.\nThere are several reasons that could account for these surprising results.\n\nSmall sample size I was only looking at cases in LA County, both of the studies I referenced earlier had much larger samples to analyze.\nLack of precipitation LA County is a notoriously sunny area, it tends to get very little precipitation year round.\nThere is an omitted variable bias. A stronger correlation to temperature Again, referencing back to the studies mentioned earlier, both showed more of a relationship between temperature and the number of reported cases than precipitation. My analysis omitted these variables because the Arcadia data set I used only had data about precipitation.\n\nReferences\nCalifornia Department of Public Health (CDPH). (2017, April 28).

Our intercept is 2.4113 which means that when there is no rainfall, the model predicts about 2.41 reported WNV cases. Unexpectedly, with our avg_weekly_prcp coefficient being -1.3915, this model would predict that for each inch of rainfall there would be -1.3915 cases of WNV. The Multiple R-squared (0.002194) also supports these results being insignificant, as it describes only 0.22% of WNV case variation could be explained by precipitation.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate the correlation between rainfall and WNV cases\ncorrelation &lt;- cor(wnv_precip$avg_weekly_prcp, wnv_precip$reported_positive_cases, use = \"complete.obs\")\nprint(paste(\"Correlation between rainfall and WNV cases:\", correlation))\n\n\n[1] \"Correlation between rainfall and WNV cases: -0.0468444447379296\"\n\n\nThis correlation (-0.0468) is consistent with our previous findings that rainfall would have a negative correlation with WNV cases.\n\n\nCode\n# Visualize the relationship with the regression line\nggplot(wnv_precip, aes(x = avg_weekly_prcp, y = reported_positive_cases)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"firebrick\") + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"glm\", color = \"navy\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Rainfall and West Nile Virus Cases\",\n    x = \"Average Weekly Rainfall (inches)\",\n    y = \"Reported Positive WNV Cases\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()"

However, the results are still completely different. With the lagged variable, the p-value is still not significant (p = 0.1184). The coefficient for the intercept did go up slightly, with the difference being 0.0484. Our lag_prcp_4weeks coefficient being -2.0339 means that for every inch of rain in the past 4 weeks, there would be -2.03 WNV cases. Lastly, we can see only about 0.45% of the variability in reported WNV cases can be explained by lagged precipitation.\n4.

The negative correlation and elevated p-values suggest that precipitation alone may not be a reliable predictor of virus transmission in Los Angeles County. In this analysis, I have failed to reject the null hypothesis.\nThere are several reasons that could account for these surprising results.\n\nSmall sample size I was only looking at cases in LA County, both of the studies I referenced earlier had much larger samples to analyze.\nLack of precipitation LA County is a notoriously sunny area, it tends to get very little precipitation year round.\nThere is an omitted variable bias. A stronger correlation to temperature Again, referencing back to the studies mentioned earlier, both showed more of a relationship between temperature and the number of reported cases than precipitation. My analysis omitted these variables because the Arcadia data set I used only had data about precipitation.\n\nReferences\nCalifornia Department of Public Health (CDPH). (2017, April 28).

The goal of this blog post is to give a quick guide on how to do just that so you can make your dream come true or live vicariously through me. First, let’s go over some background on the Thomas Fire that impacted Santa Barbara and the surrounding areas.\nI am going to be doing this in two parts. In the first part, I will be making a graph to visualize how the fire impacted air quality or the AQI. For the second part, I am going to be using false color imagery to get a better picture, or just a picture at least, of the impact the fire had on vegetation in the area. As I mentioned earlier, this post is going to highlight the functions I am going to use,\nAnd the functions are…\n\nConcat()\nRolling()\nTo_file()\nSqueeze()\nImshow()\n\nThroughout this analysis, I will highlight the places where I used the functions, mention the library they are from, and explain, roughly, what they do. In addition to the functions, I will be highlighting the overall skills I will use in each section.\n\n\nThe Thomas Fire was an extremely large wildfire that burned 378,000 acres from December 4th, 2017 to January 12th, 2018. At the time, it was considered the largest wildlife in modern California history. The fire caused massive destruction both from the flames and the subsequent mudslides. It was truly devastating. Hopefully, in learning to do this analysis we can help in finding new ways to mitigate and respond to these disasters.\n\n\n\nI am going to be using three data sets. Each data set should be openly available to use. I will talk more about the data in the sections where I use it."

This can shed light on why fires burn the way they do, which, in turn, can help us with fire management.\nI hope you enjoyed this wordy blog post, and now have a couple more functions under your belt you can use next time you want to analyze a wildfire!"

I have always found myself looking at the airplanes and wondering who or what is on those airplanes. I have been ordering stuff online for all of my adult life. I realize that the majority of items I order do not come from nearby and probably have undergone their own journeys to arrive in possession.\nAs a student in the Masters in Environmental Data Science program at the University of California Santa Barbara, I was given the opportunity to create some data visualizations on any topic of my choosing so I decided I would answer my mostly life long question about airplanes and shipping. I wanted to know where are planes coming from and going to? How much do we actually ship via freight? How has this changed over time? This is a guide on how I created the visuals I used to answer these questions.\n\n\nDefinitions and Background\n\nBackground on data\nThe data comes from the Department of Transportation’s Air Carriers: T-100 International Segment for US carriers only data. This contains information on all international flights to and from the United States, focusing primarily on freight volume (in pounds) and departure/destination details. While the dataset included IATA airport codes (3-letter location identifiers), it lacked geographic coordinates. I added this information by using the airportr package and merging the datasets.\n\n\nData loading\n\n\nCode\n# Function for reading in CSVs\nread &lt;- function(year) {\n  file_name &lt;- paste0(\"flights\", year, \".csv\") \n  file_path &lt;- here(\"blog_posts\", \"2025-3-14-air-freight-viz\", \"data\", file_name) \n  \n  # Read and filter dataset\n  df &lt;- read.csv(file_path) %&gt;%\n    filter(FREIGHT != 0) %&gt;% \n    clean_names()\n  \n  return(df)\n}\n\n\n\n\nReading in the data via the function\n\n\nCode\n# Read in data via function\n\nfreight2024 &lt;- read(2024)\nfreight2023 &lt;- read(2023)\nfreight2022 &lt;- read(2022)\nfreight2021 &lt;- read(2021)\nfreight2020 &lt;- read(2020)\nfreight2019 &lt;- read(2019)\nfreight2018 &lt;- read(2018)\nfreight2017 &lt;- read(2017)\nfreight2016 &lt;- read(2016)\nfreight2015 &lt;- read(2015)\nfreight2014 &lt;- read(2014)\nfreight2013 &lt;- read(2013)\nfreight2012 &lt;- read(2012)\nfreight2011 &lt;- read(2011)\nfreight2010 &lt;- read(2010)\nfreight2009 &lt;- read(2009)\nfreight2008 &lt;- read(2008)\nfreight2007 &lt;- read(2007)\nfreight2006 &lt;- read(2006)\nfreight2005 &lt;- read(2005)\nfreight2004 &lt;- read(2004)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create function to join datasets\njoin_freight_data &lt;- function(...) {\n  Reduce(full_join, list(...))\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Use the function to join all datasets\nfreight_all &lt;- join_freight_data(\n  freight2004, freight2005, freight2006, freight2007, \n  freight2008, freight2009, freight2010, freight2011, \n  freight2012, freight2013, freight2014, freight2015, \n  freight2016, freight2017, freight2018, freight2019, \n  freight2020, freight2021, freight2022, freight2023, \n  freight2024\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nair_coords &lt;- airports %&gt;% \n  clean_names()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Visualizations:\n\n\nThe Map\nThe first visualization I wanted to create was a map showing which airports had the largest amount of freight in pounds traveling between them. While the map adequately visualized the the connections between the airports, it should be noted that it does not accurately show the route the planes took. For example, a plane flying from Anchorage Alaska to South Korea is most likely going to fly over the pacific ocean, not over the Atlantic, Africa and the rest of Asia.\n\nData cleaning and combining for the map\n\n\nCode\n# Rename origin and dest columns\nfreight_map_data &lt;- freight_all %&gt;% \n  rename(iata_origin = origin) %&gt;% \n  rename(iata_dest = dest)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Duplicating iata coloumn\nair_coords$iata_origin = air_coords$iata\n\n# Renaming original iata column\nair_coords_rn &lt;- air_coords %&gt;% \n  rename(iata_dest = iata)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Duplicate and rename lat longs\nair_coords_rn$lat_dest = air_coords_rn$latitude\nair_coords_rn$long_dest = air_coords_rn$longitude\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Rename original lat longs\nair_duocoords &lt;- air_coords_rn %&gt;% \n  rename(lat_origin = latitude) %&gt;% \n  rename(long_origin = longitude)\n\n\n\n\nJoining the data\nThis is where I joined the edited freight data with the airport coordinate data.\n\n\nCode\n# Join freight_all with air_duocoords to get destination coordinates\nfreight_coords &lt;- freight_map_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(air_duocoords %&gt;%\n              select(iata_dest, lat_dest, long_dest), \n            by = \"iata_dest\") %&gt;%\n  # Join again to get origin coordinates\n  left_join(air_duocoords %&gt;%\n              select(iata_origin, lat_origin, long_origin), \n            by = \"iata_origin\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nairport_routes &lt;- freight_coords %&gt;%\n  group_by(iata_origin, iata_dest) %&gt;%\n  mutate(freight_shipped = sum(freight, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%  # Sum freight shipped for each route\n  ungroup() %&gt;%  # Remove grouping after adding the freight count\n  distinct(iata_origin, iata_dest, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;%  # Keep only unique routes\n  arrange(desc(freight_shipped)) \n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Filtering for the top 20 routes\ntop_20_routes &lt;- airport_routes %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(freight_shipped)) %&gt;%\n  head(20)\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the map\nTo create the map, I used ggplot2. I used geom_curve to ensure the lines between the airports were curved and not just straight.\n\n\nCode\n# Define an aviation-themed color palette\naviation_pal &lt;- c(\"#1E3A8A\", \"#d2232aff\", \"#e369a2ff\", \"#93C5FD\",  \n                  \"#6366F1\", \"#f68b21ff\", \"#FACC15\", \"#F97316\",  \n                  \"#64748B\", \"#94A3B8\", \"#CBD5E1\", \"#E5E7EB\")  \n\n# Get world map data\nworld_map &lt;- map_data(\"world\")\n\n# Create ggplot \nmap_pounds &lt;- ggplot() +\n  # Add world map background with aviation theme\n  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"#CBD5E1\", color = \"#CBD5E1\") +  # Light gray-blue for land with slightly darker borders\n  \n  # Add curved lines for routes\n  geom_curve(data = top_20_routes, \n             aes(x = long_origin, y = lat_origin, \n                 xend = long_dest, yend = lat_dest),\n             color = \"#3B82F6\",  # Medium blue for flight paths\n             curvature = 0.2, size = .5, alpha = 0.8) +\n  \n  # Add points for origin airports\n  geom_point(data = top_20_routes, aes(x = long_origin, y = lat_origin, color = \"Origin\"), \n             size = 1) +\n  \n  # Add points for destination airports\n  geom_point(data = top_20_routes, aes(x = long_dest, y = lat_dest, color = \"Destination\"), \n             size = 1) +\n  \n  # Theme settings matching the bump chart style\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid = element_blank(),\n\n        legend.position = c(.48, .013),\n        legend.justification = c(\"center\"),\n        legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n        plot.margin = margin(20, 50, 20, 50)\n        ) +\n  \n  # Add the legend with colors from aviation palette\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Origin\" = \"#EAB308\",  # Gold for origin points (resembles takeoff)\n                                \"Destination\" = \"#F97316\"),  # Orange for destination points (resembles landing)\n                     name = \" \") +\n  \n  labs(title = \"Top Air-Freight Connections\", \n       x = \"\", y = \"\")\n\n# Store the plot in a variable\nroute_map &lt;- map_pounds\nroute_map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI enjoy looking at the map and imagining which planes might be coming from different areas.\n\n\n\nThe bump chart\nThe data I am using includes information from 2004 all the way to 2024. For the basic map made above, I used information from all the years. However, where things are coming from and going to has almost certainly changed over the past 20 years. This is where I thought using a bump chart could effectively show how things have shifted over the past several years.\n\n\nCode\n# Get the amount of freight based on the non us country \nother_countries_col &lt;- freight_all %&gt;% \n  mutate(other_country = ifelse(origin_country_name == \"United States\", dest_country_name, origin_country_name)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(other_country, year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_freight = sum(freight, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Rank the number one countries by year\ncountry_rank_by_year &lt;- other_countries_col %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt;= 2019) %&gt;% \n  select(year, other_country, total_freight) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    rank = row_number(desc(total_freight))\n  ) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  arrange(rank, year)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for 2024\ntop_countries_2024 &lt;- country_rank_by_year %&gt;% \n  filter(year == 2024, rank &lt;= 10) %&gt;% \n  pull(other_country)\n\n\n\nPlotting the bump chart\nThe reasoning behind using a bump chart for this visualization is not only because it can display the information accurately, but also because it gives a sense of flow and travel. One of the key themes I want on my visualization is a sense of movement and forward flow.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(country_rank_by_year %&gt;% filter(other_country %in% top_countries_2024), \n       aes(x = year, y = rank, color = other_country)) + \n\n  # Add smooth curved lines\n  geom_bump(linewidth = 1.5) +\n\n  # Add points for better visibility\n  geom_point(size = 4) +\n\n  # Left-side country labels (adjusted positioning)\n  geom_text(\n    data = country_rank_by_year %&gt;% filter(year == 2019, other_country %in% top_countries_2024),\n    aes(label = other_country), \n    hjust = 1, \n    nudge_x = -0.15, \n    size = 5, \n    fontface = \"bold\"\n  ) +\n\n  # Right-side rank labels (adjusted positioning)\n  geom_text(\n    data = country_rank_by_year %&gt;% filter(year == 2024, other_country %in% top_countries_2024),\n    aes(label = rank), \n    hjust = 0, \n    nudge_x = 0.15, \n    size = 5, \n    fontface = \"bold\"\n  ) +\n\n  # Reverse y-axis for ranking (1st place at the top)\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n\n  # Apply aviation color palette\n  scale_color_manual(values = aviation_pal, guide = \"none\") +\n\n  # Adjust boundaries to prevent cutoff\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(2018.9, 2024.1), ylim = c(11, 0.5), clip = \"off\") +\n  \n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Air-Freight Trade Partners of the U.S\") +\n  \n  # Aesthetic improvements\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.margin = margin(20, 50, 20, 100) # Increased margins\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the timeline\nAfter creating the bump chart, my next goal was to create a timeline that showed how the amount of freight in pounds has changed over the past 20 years. When I was thinking of how to put all of the elements together, I originally wanted the bump chart and the timeline to focus on the same amount of years. However, when I lengthened the time frame of the bump chart, the information got harder to follow and it lost its use in conveying information. When I tried to shorten the timeline, certain events like the freight recession, became less noticeable. Ultimately, I decided it was better and more interesting if the plots focused on different years.\n\n\nCode\n# Convert year and month into a proper date format\nfreight_all &lt;- freight_all %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, 1))\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Aggregate freight by month\nfreight_month &lt;- freight_all %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, month) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_freight = sum(freight, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, 1)) \n\n\n\nPlotting the timeline\nPlotting the timeline involved making some of the harder visual decisions. I wanted to show the lines for each year, but I was afraid that would take away from the general cohesiveness of all the elements put together. Ultimately, I think it worked out but it was challenging for me to figure out how I could make it cohesive.\n\n\nCode\ntimeline &lt;- \n  ggplot(freight_month, aes(x = date, y = total_freight)) +\n  geom_smooth(color = \"#1E3A8A\", size = 1, span = 0.1, se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%Y\", date_breaks = \"24 months\") +  \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    labels = scales::label_number(scale = 1e-6, suffix = \"M lb\", big.mark = \",\")  \n  ) +\n  labs(title = \"Pounds of Air-Freight Moved To and From The USA\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"\") +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),  # Match bump chart title\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),  \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),  \n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),  \n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    plot.margin = margin(20, 50, 20, 50)  # Ensure proper spacing\n  ) \n\nprint(timeline)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final visuals\nOnce all those pieces were finished, I used google slides to put to final pieces together.\n\n\n\nThe final product:"
