Amanda hopes to develop the connection between gathering the data and sharing it through the MEDS program at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. She is especially drawn to data processing and visualization. Her research interests are the long-term impacts of climate change and human development on terrestrial mammalian movement and migration. Amandaâ€™s goal is to do responsible scientific research that is accessible and understandable to a broad range of audiences.
